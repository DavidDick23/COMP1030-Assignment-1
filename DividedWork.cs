//Declare and assign three string variables for three different types of flooring each with a price per square foot (perhaps "Hardwood ($8.95/sq.ft.)" as an example - come up with something original, here).
//Declare a variable to capture the user's choice of flooring type.
//Declare two variables to represent the length and width of a room (using feet measured to one decimal point).
//Ask the user the length of the room they are looking to install the new flooring.

//Check to see that the user has inputted a number - if yes, then store this value in the length variable created in step 4, if no then output an appropriate error message to the console.
//Ask the user the width of the room they are looking to install the new flooring.
//Check to see that the user has inputted a number - if yes, then store this value in the length variable created in step 4, if no then output an appropriate error message to the console.
//Ask the user what type of flooring they would like, by building a sentence using the variables created in step 2 - to make it easy for the user, perhaps assign letters to each choice.

//Check to see that the user has inputted a letter (one of the three choices for flooring) - if yes, then store this value in the variable created in step 3, if no then output an appropriate error message to the console.
//Create a series of if() statements that correspond to each choice of flooring.
//Inside each of the if() statements, do some math: get the area of the floor to be covered, and multiply that by the price of the selected floor type.
//Output a sentence to the user indicating what floor type they picked, the area of the floor they are covering, and the final cost.
